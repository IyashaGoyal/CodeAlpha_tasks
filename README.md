<h3>Introduction</h3>
The CodeAlpha internship program offers opportunities for students and professionals to gain practical experience in data science, machine learning, and software development.

<h3>Tasks</h3>
As an intern at CodeAlpha, I was assigned tasks related to stock prediction, Titanic classification, and A/B testing analysis, which allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world projects.

<h3>Learning Experience</h3>
Throughout the internship, I gained valuable experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation techniques, and interpreting results, which enhanced my understanding of data science concepts.

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
I would like to express my gratitude to my mentors and colleagues at CodeAlpha for their guidance, support, and encouragement throughout the internship.

<h2>Stock Prediction</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
Stock prediction involves using historical data and various techniques to forecast future stock prices. It's crucial for investors, traders, and financial institutions to make informed decisions.

<h3>Approach</h3>
We employed machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, random forest, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, to analyze historical stock data and make predictions.

<h3>Data</h3>
We utilized historical stock prices, trading volumes, financial ratios, and other relevant indicators obtained from reputable financial data providers or APIs.

<h3>Results</h3>
The stock prediction model achieved a certain level of accuracy, which was evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or accuracy score.

<h3>Usage</h3>
To use the stock prediction model, users can input historical data and run the provided code to generate predictions for future stock prices.

<h2>Titanic Classification</h2>

TitanicClassification.ipynb

<h3>Overview</h3>
Titanic classification involves predicting whether a passenger survived or perished in the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and cabin location.

<h3>Data</h3>
We utilized the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers onboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

<h3>Approach</h3>
We employed various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines (SVM), to classify passengers into survived or not survived categories.

<h3>Results</h3>
The classification model's performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its effectiveness in predicting survival outcomes.

<h3>Usage</h3>
Users can input passenger information and run the provided code to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster.

<h3>Files used</h3>
train.csv for model building,test.csv for prediction.

<h2>A/B Testing Analysis</h2>

<h3>file</h3>
a_b_testing_analysis.ipynb

<h3>Overview</h3>
A/B testing is a method used to compare two versions (A and B) of a webpage, app, or marketing strategy to determine which one performs better in terms of a desired outcome.

<h3>Data</h3>
We collected data from users or customers who were randomly assigned to either the control group (version A) or the treatment group (version B) during the experiment.

<h3>Methodology</h3>
We employed statistical techniques like hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests or chi-square tests) or Bayesian inference to analyze the A/B test results and determine if there's a statistically significant difference between the two versions.

<h3>Results</h3>
The analysis provided insights into which version (A or B) performed better based on metrics like conversion rate, click-through rate, or revenue generated.

<h3>Usage</h3>
Users can follow the provided instructions to conduct their own A/B testing analysis by inputting relevant data and running the code.

<h3>Files used</h3>
cookie_cats.csv has been used as a dataset.
