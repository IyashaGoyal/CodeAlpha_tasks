CodeAlpha Internship:
Introduction: The CodeAlpha internship program offers opportunities for students and professionals to gain practical experience in data science, machine learning, and software development.
Tasks: As an intern at CodeAlpha, I was assigned tasks related to stock prediction, Titanic classification, and A/B testing analysis, which allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world projects.
Learning Experience: Throughout the internship, I gained valuable experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation techniques, and interpreting results, which enhanced my understanding of data science concepts.
Acknowledgments: I would like to express my gratitude to my mentors and colleagues at CodeAlpha for their guidance, support, and encouragement throughout the internship.
